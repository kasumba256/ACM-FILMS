              <h5>WEDDING CINEMATROGRAPHER</h5>
              <P>Washington D.C. born and raised, I’ve been slinging cameras professionally <br>
                across the DMV and beyond since 2015. 
                 In 2018, I earned my wings, started flying my own <br>lag and haven’t looked back since.
                 When Iʼm not shooting, <br>
                 you can find me rocking out on my vintage fender jaguar 
                 and keeping up with my indoor garden. <br>What can I say? Life is about the little things!
                My style of photography is vibrant and colorful, <br>just the way I like my couples. 
                As your photographer, it’s my job to not only capture how good you look, but how great you feel. --</P>
