            Hi there!! My name is Akram and I am the lead Filmmaker, editor and creative director of Unleashed Vizuals. The first time I picked up a camera I was about 10! My mother always made me the person in charge of holding the camera, which resulted in me taking all the pictures and videos at all of our family reunions and birthday parties. 
            I was always the person behind the lens and never in front of the lens. 
            At a young age I relized how much joy can be captured by a click of a button. 
            
            ​
            
            As I got older, I grew a passion for filming. My passion has led me to create some awesome films for amazing couples and clients. 
            Filming has allowed me to meet new creatives and also take me to destinations that I’ve never imaged that I would visit! In my films I try to be creative as possible and bring something new to the table. My clients continue to challenge me with their ideas, I take those ideas and suggestions and implement them in my films. 
            
            Let my team and I tell your story!</p>
